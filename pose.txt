The three-quarter turn
Pushing shoulders forwards
Leg up on a wall
Exaggerated leaning pose
Sitting with one leg bent
Walking with hand in pockets
Sitting on the floor
Standing with arms crossed
Sitting and looking away
Arms crossed at the back
Fluid pose with arm out
Hands cinching waist
Sitting with legs wide
Crouching in front of a wall
Standing with one foot against a wall
Dramatic lean on the wall
Sitting on a chair with an elbow resting on the knee
Hands on hips
Full frontal close-up
Leaning on something
Shooting on movement
Facial play
Almost sideways
Totally sideways
Standing back to the camera
Standing near chair
Hands in pockets
Strolling
